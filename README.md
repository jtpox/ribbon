## ribbon
A personal content management system project that uses **Express**, **MongoDB**.

## Front-end
I plan to use the ~~React Javascript library~~ Angular Framework for the front-end user interface.

I'll learn React when I have more time -.-

## Dependencies

 - [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
 - [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)

## Initial Setup

 1. Run `npm install`
 2. Edit `config/database.json` to link it to your MongoDB
 3. Visit `<url>/install` to set up initial database.
 4. Go to `<url>/ribbon` and log in with `admin@admin.com` and `password` to enter the admin panel.
 5. Create a new user before deleting the **admin** account!
